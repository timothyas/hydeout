I am currently a Research Associate at
<a href="https://cires.colorado.edu/">
    the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES)</a>
and
<a href="https://psl.noaa.gov/"> NOAA's Physical Sciences Lab (PSL)</a>.
The main goal of my research is to develop Artificial Recurrent Neural Networks
that can make accurate predictions of oceanic quantities, such as
sea surface temperature or current speeds.
I am working with Steve Penny and PSL's
<a href="https://psl.noaa.gov/attribution-assessments/"> 
    Attribution and Predictability Assessments (APA) group </a>
to integrate these neural networks into modern data assimilation methods to enable
computationally efficient, robust, data-driven weather forecasts.
The eventual goal is to integrate our developments into the
<a href="https://hfip.org/hafs">
    Hurricane Analysis and Forecast System (HAFS)</a>.
</p>

Before joining PSL, I obtained my Ph.D. in Computational Science, Engineering, and
Mathematics from the
<a href="https://oden.utexas.edu">
    Oden Institute</a>
at <a href"https://utexas.edu">UT Austin</a>.
My graduate work focused on quantifying uncertainties that are inherent to
ocean models, and I implemented a generic, adjoint-based framework to propagate
these uncertainties onto predictions from the
<a href="http://mitgcm.org/"> MIT general circulation model</a>.
I used this framework to show how sparse observations of the ocean state
reduce uncertainty in simulation-based estimates of ocean driven melting underneath
the Pine Island ice shelf, which is fed by one of the fastest
flowing glaciers in Antarctica.
Broadly speaking, I am interested in developing open source computational tools to 
better understand oceanographic processes relevant to the climate
system and quantify their uncertainties.

When I'm not working, I love to go rock climbing, skiing/snowboarding, trail running,
and cycling in the beautiful Colorado outdoors.
