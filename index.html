        I am currently a Research Associate at
        <a href="https://cires.colorado.edu/">
            the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) </a>
        and
        <a href="https://psl.noaa.gov/"> NOAA's Physical Sciences Lab (PSL) </a>.
        The main goal of my research is to develop Artificial Recurrent Neural Networks
        that can accurately predict the time evolution of oceanic quantities, such as
        sea surface temperature or current speeds.
        I am working with Steve Penny and PSL's
        <a href="https://psl.noaa.gov/attribution-assessments/"> 
            Attribution and Predictability Assessments (APA) group </a>
        to integrate machine learning and data assimilation methods to enable
        computationally efficient, data-driven weather forecasts.
        The eventual goal is to integrate these methods into the
        <a href="https://hfip.org/hafs">
            Hurricane Analysis and Forecast System (HAFS) </a>.

Before joining PSL, I obtained my Ph.D. in Computational Science, Engineering, and
Mathematics from the
<a href="https://oden.utexas.edu">
    Oden Institute</a>, 
at <a href"https://utexas.edu">UT Austin</a>.
My graduate work focused on quantifying uncertainties that are inherent to
ocean models, and I implemented a generic, adjoint-based framework to propagate
these uncertainties onto predictions from the
<a href="http://mitgcm.org/"> MIT general circulation model</a>.
I used this framework to show how sparse observations of the ocean state
reduce our uncertainty in simulation-based estimates of ocean driven melting underneath
the Pine Island ice shelf, which is fed by one of the fastest
flowing glaciers in Antarctica.
Broadly speaking, I am interested in developing open source computational tools to 
better understand oceanographic processes relevant to the climate
system and quantify their uncertainties.

When I'm not working, I love to go rock climbing, skiing/snowboarding, trail running,
and cycling in the beautiful Colorado outdoors.
