<p>
I am currently a Research Scientist at
<a href="https://cires.colorado.edu/">
    the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES)</a>
and
<a href="https://psl.noaa.gov/"> NOAA's Physical Sciences Lab (PSL)</a>.
The main goal of my current research is to integrate Machine Learning and Artificial
Intelligence techniques into the Data Assimilation methods that our weather forecasting
systems rely on.
In this work I am exploring a number of paths, including the development of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogate_model">
    surrogate models</a>
that can be used as a cheap replacement of our forecast model, and neural network maps
to accelerate the characterization of model uncertainty within a Data Assimilation cycle.
</p>

<p>
Before joining PSL, I obtained my Ph.D. in Computational Science, Engineering, and
Mathematics from the
<a href="https://oden.utexas.edu">
    Oden Institute</a>
at <a href"https://utexas.edu">UT Austin</a>.
My graduate work focused on quantifying uncertainties that are inherent to
ocean models, and I implemented a generic, adjoint-based framework to propagate
these uncertainties onto predictions from the
<a href="http://mitgcm.org/"> MIT general circulation model</a>.
I used this framework to show how sparse observations of the ocean state
reduce uncertainty in simulation-based estimates of ocean driven melting underneath
the Pine Island ice shelf, which is fed by one of the fastest
flowing glaciers in Antarctica.
The results showed how valuable observations in this region are for constraining modeled quantities.
</p>

<p>
Broadly speaking, I am motivated to develop open source computational tools that help
improve our weather forecasts and climate projections.

When I'm not working, I love to go rock climbing, skiing/snowboarding, trail running,
and cycling in the beautiful Colorado outdoors.
